%%%% Bio %%%%
% \header{Introduction}
% \begin{body}
%     \vspace{14pt}
%     I am currently a Ph.D. student at Yonsei University. I relocated to KAIST in February 2024 to continue my research with my advisor, Prof. Noseong Park, and currently I am staying at KAIST. My research interests span a variety of areas, including graph neural networks, recommender systems, spatio-temporal forecasting, and differential equations. I have developed graph-based deep learning methods inspired by differential equations in natural science, such as heat diffusion and reaction-diffusion equations. Recently, my focus on research has been extending the self-attention mechanism, the heart of Transformers, into the concept of graph signal processing.
