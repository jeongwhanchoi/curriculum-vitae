\header{Introduction}
\begin{body}
    \vspace{14pt}
 I am an integrated Ph.D. student advised by \href{https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VSuM3gYAAAAJ&hl=en}{Noseong Park} in the Dep. of \emph{Artificial Intelligence} at Yonsei University. I have a broad interest in graph neural networks, recommender systems, spatio-temporal forecasting, and differential equations. Recently, I have been working on developing graph-based deep learning methods inspired by differential equations in natural science.

I was an undergrad at Jeonbuk National University (2016-2020), majoring in \emph{software engineering}. I was privileged to be advised by \href{https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IN_HTKEAAAAJ&hl=en}{Suntae Kim} and \href{https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BHue-MMAAAAJ&hl=en}{Duksan Ryu}.
